# üìä Manufacturing Efficiency Dashboard
**Enhancing Manufacturing Performance Through Data-Driven Insights**

## üîç Project Overview

This project leverages **manufacturing production data** and **employee performance metrics** to uncover inefficiencies, identify trends, and drive operational improvements. Built using **Power BI**, the dashboard offers a centralized, interactive view of key factors influencing manufacturing efficiency ‚Äî including production costs, workforce productivity, and training investments.

By visualizing these elements together, stakeholders can make informed decisions that align cost management with workforce optimization and strategic growth.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze **production cost trends**, **output quantities**, and **efficiency ratios** across product lines and locations.
- Evaluate how **employee training** and **performance ratings** impact overall productivity.
- Investigate the relationship between **salary levels** and **workforce output** for better HR planning.
- Deliver **actionable insights** through intuitive dashboards to support leadership decision-making.

## üíª Code Implementation

### Power Query (M Language) - Data Cleaning

```m
// Clean Manufacturing Production Data
let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("Manufacturing_Data.xlsx"), null, true),
    Production_Data = Source{[Item="Production",Kind="Sheet"]}[Data],
    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Production_Data, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Promoted Headers",{
        {"ProductID", Int64.Type}, 
        {"ProductType", type text}, 
        {"ProductionDate", type date}, 
        {"ProductionCost", Currency.Type}, 
        {"CountryOfOrigin", type text}, 
        {"QuantityProduced", Int64.Type}, 
        {"WarehouseLocation", type text}
    }),
    #"Added Efficiency Column" = Table.AddColumn(#"Changed Type", "CostPerUnit", each [ProductionCost]/[QuantityProduced])
in
    #"Added Efficiency Column"
